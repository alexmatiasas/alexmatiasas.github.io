## üéØ Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of **[50,000 IMDb movie reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)**, each labeled as _positive_ or _negative_. The goal is to classify sentiment through a two-phase workflow:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis and preprocessing in R**  
2. **Sentiment classification modeling and deployment in Python**

The first phase leverages R‚Äôs rich ecosystem for text manipulation and data visualization. The second phase (in progress) will involve training ML models and deploying a classifier using Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- **R**: `tidyverse`, `tidytext`, `ggplot2`, `udpipe`, `SnowballC`, `textstem`, `DT`
- **Python** (planned): `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `PyTorch`
- **Techniques**: Tokenization, POS tagging, stemming, lemmatization, n-grams, polarity
- **Format**: R Markdown (`.Rmd`) ‚Üí HTML (via RPubs)

---

## üìä Key Explorations

- Sentiment class distribution and review length analysis
- HTML cleaning, stopword removal, punctuation & casing normalization
- **POS tagging** using `udpipe`
- **Stemming** (`SnowballC`) and **lemmatization** (`textstem`)
- **N-gram analysis** for phrase structure insight

---

## üìà Visualizations Preview

Some of the visualizations in the EDA notebook include:

- Word frequency lollipop charts
- Sentiment-based word clouds
- N-gram distribution (bigrams & trigrams)
- Polarity sentiment barplots

üöß _Interactive notebook will be available soon via RPubs._

## üìò Full Exploratory Report

üõ†Ô∏è _The full report with interactive visualizations is currently being compiled and will be published shortly on RPubs._

## üîÆ Next Steps

- Export cleaned data to `.csv` for model training
- Build classifiers using:
  - Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes (baseline)
  - Pipeline-based ML models (`scikit-learn`)
  - Deep learning model using `PyTorch` (planned)
- Evaluation: **Confusion Matrix**, **F1 Score**, **ROC-AUC**
- Optionally deploy via **Streamlit** or **Apache Spark**

## üßæ Deliverables

## üßæ Deliverables

- [`01_EDA.Rmd`](https://github.com/alexmatiasas/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/notebooks/01_EDA.Rmd) ‚Äî Core notebook (R-based)
- Cleaned datasets (stemmed, lemmatized, udpipe); export planned for modeling phase
- _EDA report (RPubs) ‚Äî Coming soon_
- `model_sentiment.py` ‚Äî (Coming soon)
- Streamlit or Apache Spark deployment ‚Äî (Planned)

## üìå Outcome

> Completed a robust EDA and text processing pipeline in R.  
> Laying the foundation for cross-platform sentiment classification with Python.

---

## üß† What I Learned

- R is powerful for quick and elegant EDA and text visualization.
- Handling natural language data requires both linguistic and statistical intuition.
- Preprocessing choices (e.g., stemming vs lemmatization) can deeply affect downstream model performance.
