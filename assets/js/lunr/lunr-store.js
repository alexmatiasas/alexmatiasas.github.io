        "excerpt":"The Beginning of the Journey   Hi! I’m Alejandro, a physicist with a deep passion for data-driven problems. After years in academia, I’ve decided to pivot into Data Science — and I’m building my portfolio one real-world project at a time.   What I’m Doing   I’m not just following tutorials — I’m building practical projects that reflect industry-relevant challenges, such as:      📊 Sentiment Analysis — currently in progress!   🤖 Object Detection   🧠 Recommendation Engines   📦 ML Pipelines &amp; MLOps   Why Build in Public?   I want to be transparent with my journey. This blog (and my website) will be the place where I showcase not only the results, but also the learning process. That way, employers and collaborators can follow along and see my evolution. a   🔧 Project Progress                  Project       Status       Progress                       Sentiment Analysis       In Progress       🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ (40%)                 Object Detection       Planned       🔵⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ (10%)                 Recommendation System       Planned       ⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ (0%)                 Text Generation       Planned       ⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪⚪ (0%)           Follow the Progress   Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub to follow my work.

The goal is to classify sentiment through a two-phase workflow:      Exploratory Data Analysis and preprocessing in R   Sentiment classification modeling and deployment in Python   The first phase leverages R’s rich ecosystem for text manipulation and data visualization. The second phase (in progress) will involve training ML models and deploying a classifier using Python.     🛠️ Tools &amp; Libraries      R: tidyverse, tidytext, ggplot2, udpipe, SnowballC, textstem, DT   Python (planned): scikit-learn, nltk, pandas, matplotlib, PyTorch   Techniques: Tokenization, POS tagging, stemming, lemmatization, n-grams, polarity   Format: R Markdown (.Rmd) → HTML (via RPubs)     📊 Key Explorations      Sentiment class distribution and review length analysis   HTML cleaning, stopword removal, punctuation &amp; casing normalization   POS tagging using udpipe   Stemming (SnowballC) and lemmatization (textstem)   N-gram analysis for phrase structure insight     📈 Visualizations Preview   Some of the visualizations in the RPubs notebook include:      Word frequency lollipop charts   Sentiment-based word clouds   N-gram distribution (bigrams &amp; trigrams)   Polarity sentiment barplots   ➡️ Explore the full interactive report here     📘 Full Exploratory Report   🔗 View the full EDA on RPubs  (Hosted via RStudio’s RPubs; includes interactive visuals and data breakdown)     🔮 Next Steps      Export cleaned data to .csv for model training   Build classifiers using:            Logistic Regression &amp; Naive Bayes (baseline)       Pipeline-based ML models (scikit-learn)       Deep learning model using PyTorch (planned)           Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, ROC-AUC   Optionally deploy via Streamlit or Apache Spark     🧾 Deliverables      sentiment-analysis.Rmd — Core analysis (published on RPubs)   IMDB-cleaned.csv — Cleaned dataset (not public due to size, available on request)   model_sentiment.py — Machine learning model (coming soon)   Streamlit dashboard or deployment interface (planned)   GitHub repository (in process)     📌 Outcome      Completed a robust EDA and text processing pipeline in R.  Laying the foundation for cross-platform sentiment classification with Python.      🧠 What I Learned      R is powerful for quick and elegant EDA and text visualization.   Handling natural language data requires both linguistic and statistical intuition.   Preprocessing choices (e.g., stemming vs lemmatization) can deeply affect downstream model performance.   🔗 View this project on GitHub     Last updated: 2025-04-20  ","categories": [],
