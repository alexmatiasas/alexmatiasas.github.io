## The Beginning of the Journey

Hi! Iâ€™m Alejandro, a physicist with a deep passion for data-driven problems. After years in academia, Iâ€™ve decided to pivot into Data Science â€” and Iâ€™m building my portfolio one real-world project at a time.

## What Iâ€™m Doing

I'm not just following tutorials â€” I'm building practical projects that reflect industry-relevant challenges, such as:

- ðŸ“Š **Sentiment Analysis** â€” currently in progress!
- ðŸ¤– **Object Detection**
- ðŸ§  **Recommendation Engines**
- ðŸ“¦ **ML Pipelines & MLOps**

## Why Build in Public?

I want to be transparent with my journey. This blog (and my website) will be the place where I showcase not only the results, but also the learning process. That way, employers and collaborators can follow along and see my evolution. a
